# Greenlight

Greenlight is a roleplaying game in which your group will create your own television series. Each player will develop a character that is the star of their own story-line. Together, you will explore the interconnected stories of an entire television season in a single session.

## The Basics

**What you'll Need**

* Some other human beings. A few or more but, less than lots. (3-5 for people who like numbers)
* Two types of tokens totaling three times the number of players split approximately evenly between the types.
* At least one pitch. *Fox Harbor* is the only one currently available.

**How to Behave**

* Think cinematically, go beyond, establish what the viewers hear and see every scene.
* Discover the story, let go, share the load
* stay safe, stick to the rating, character authority
* **Hold others accountable for this stuff**

## Setup

Choose a pitch.

Agree to a Rating.

Read the **Synopsis**.

Read the **Cold Opening** and answer any of the prompts.

Read the **Vocabulary**.

Each player, choose a **Character** not already chosen.

### History

Each player, take a turn to choose a **Character** or **Location** not already chosen. Discuss with the next player how this connects both of your characters.

## Playing the Game

Each player takes turns in the **Spotlight**. When every player has had a turn, that is one round. A normal game has three rounds. When all rounds are complete, your group moves on the the **Wrapping Up** phase of the game.

### Spotlight

Create a scene for your **Character**. Choose a **Scenario** now or an **Approach** after. The rest of the group  chooses the other option. Whichever group picks the option should follow the directions for that type.

> When you get a **Scenario**, you can decide where it goes in relation to other events. An  **Approach** may only be chosen if there are tokens remaining for it.

**Scenario**
* Where is the character? (Choose a **Location**)
* What other characters are here? (Choose at least one **Character**)

**Approach**
Answer the questions on the card.

Choose an **Action**.

The scene takes place in the middle of the action. Recruit the other players to take on the roles of any other characters involved in the scene. When everything is setup, jump into the action and play out the scene.

Your agenda during the scene is to find out what happens in the constructed **Scenario** and to introduce a **Consequence** based on your chosen **Action**. When you fulfill your agenda, Another player can give you a token matching your **Approach**.

> **When to give tokens.** Giving a token is a signal that the other players are satisfied that the spotlighted player has fulfilled their agenda. The spotlighted player should take receiving a token as a cue that they can finish up the scene. If the spotlighted play hasn't gotten a token perhaps their is some disagreement over the agenda. Players should push the scene towards fulfilling the agenda through their own characterization and failing that, by asking questions

### Wrapping Up

The player with the most ~~Tack~~ tokens gets to narrate the end of the season.

The player with the most ~~Jibe~~ tokens gets to narrate the trailer for the next season.

In cases of a ties, tied players may accept tokens from other players for assured concessions to their narration. Negotiations continue until no other players are willing to give away their tokens and there is no longer a tie.
