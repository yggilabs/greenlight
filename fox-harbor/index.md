# Fox Harbor

An isolated town with secrets hiding in the mists

### Synopsis

Fox Harbor is an idyllic town nestled in the protected waters of its namesake. The people are hard-working, they carry on the traditions of their past. The waters are bountiful, they provide everything that residents might need.

The town is on an island, the only point on the map. The town is large enough that most residents don't know each other by name but, small enough to note an unfamiliar face. The island is large enough that none have seen it's entirety but, small enough that someone has seen everything.

But, something is wrong... the traditions of the past are not as wholesome as some wish to remember and, more than fish comes out from the waters.
